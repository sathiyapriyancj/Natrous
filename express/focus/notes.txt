APIs on a higher level,

- Introduce you to the REST Architecture.
- Which is the most used API architecture today.

REST

- Representational States Transfer 
- It is basically a way of building web APIs in a logical way, making them easy to consume.
- We build RESTful APIs which means APIs following the REST Architecture, we just need to follow a couple of principles.

1. Separate API into logical resources.
2. Expose structured, resource-based URLs.
3. Use  right method HTTP methods(verbs).
4. Send data as JSON.
5. Be stateless.
