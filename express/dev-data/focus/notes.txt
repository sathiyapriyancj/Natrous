Param Middleware 

1. param middleware is middleware that only runs for certain parameters.

2. So basically, when we have a certain parameter in our URL.

3. Param Middleware When this id is present in the URL.

4. Be careful with return else it continue cycle of request and response. (Note it is a pattern).

5. we should always work with middleware stack.



Real use case : 

1. Validate a id of user instead of define a single method in controller.
